Procedural Room Generation

A small experimental project written during a number of self-dev days with the aim of procedurally generating a number of rooms similar to how it is done in Rogue Legacy.

Room generation can be configured on the Room Generator script component on the RoomGenerator object in the Rooms scene.
Special Rooms e.g. Shop, Boss Room are part of the generation.


Included is a simple player controller which allows the rooms to be navigated through by using standard keyboard controls.
The Boss Room is locked once generation is complete and can be unlocked by finding the key that is spawned in one of the non-special rooms.
